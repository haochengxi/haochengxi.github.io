# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a first-year PhD student in UC Berkeley. My research interest is about efficient 
          training and inference of large language models and diffusion models. 
          I graduate from Yao Class, Tsinghua University, led by [Prof.Andrew Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/).
          <br><br>
          My advisor is [Prof.Kurt Keutzer](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~keutzer/), and I also work closely with 
          [Prof.Song Han](https://hanlab.mit.edu/songhan) in MIT. 
          Back in Tsinghua University, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Jianfei Chen](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianfei/) and 
          [Prof.Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). I was also fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) in University of Washington.'
